# START (String Temporal Annoation and Relation Tool)

This tool is available online as part of my PhD thesis submission at [this link](http://scss.tcd.ie/~dwoods/thesis/code/start) or [this one](https://start-dwoodscs.vercel.app)

If you wish to run the tool locally, you will need to have the following installed:

* git
* nodejs
* npm
* python3
* vercel

To install and run locally, run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/dave-woods/thesis.git
cd thesis/code/start
npm i
vercel dev
```

If everything worked correctly, you should be able to find the tool running on `localhost:3000`.
